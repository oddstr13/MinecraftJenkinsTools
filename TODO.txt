Todo:
 * Add caching of Forge installed on top of MCP - installing Forge every time wastes CPU time and electicity.
    * Check for cached version if usemcp and useforge, if there is a cached version for the mcpversion and forge_build combination in question, use it.
      If not, then create a cached version, a zip of the contents of mcp, without the modsource.
      Example: cache/mcp-forge/mcp72-forge241.zip
      If cached version does exist, use it.
 * Move from using src/minecraft/ and src/minecraft_server/, and use src/, as the source and target when copying in place the source.
 * Add config option to tell if reobf/minecraft/ is for the client only, or common for client and server.
